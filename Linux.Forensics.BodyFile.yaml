description: |
  This artifact collects detailed file metadata from key Linux directories, including /tmp, /home, /etc, /var, /usr, /boot, /opt, /lib, and /root. 
  It gathers information such as file size, modification time, access time, creation time, and whether the file is a directory or a symbolic link. 
  For symbolic links, the artifact also captures the target path that the symlink points to. The collection is limited to 6 directory levels deep to ensure efficient analysis.
